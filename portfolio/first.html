        <center><h3>About Me...</h3></center>

        <p>My name is Mis Riya.I am from Bangladesh. I am 18 years old. I am currently a senior at Detroit International Academy and I hold a High School Intern Position at Rocket Mortgage. My current GPA is 4.0. I will be attending Wayne State University in the fall of 2022, majoring in Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>I am passionate about technology because technology is everywhere nowadays and there is so much you could do with it. For instance, solving real-life problems such as communication. It provides communication all over the world and helps connect. For example- nowadays you can create your own website for a donation project, be creative and raise money to solve issues such as poverty, and water crisis. Some of my hobbies include Badminton, reading, watching T.V shows, and spending time with my family. 
        </p>
        <p>Throughout my high school journey, I have been involved in various leadership roles. Last year, I helped to conduct a march for the people suffering in Palestine to bring awareness and wrote to The President of The United States about my concerns. The march took place around my school. I want to make a difference in this world. I am very passionate about social justice and advocacy.  I am also part of the Thirst project which is a movement of students all over the world, raising awareness about the global water crisis and helping to end it. This is the link to my thirst project page that I created to raise money to help build wells around the world so that everyone can have access to fresh water. https://my.thirstproject.org/fundraiser/3206888. Water is a basic necessity for living and I believe that everyone deserves to have access to clean water.</p>
